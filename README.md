Cryomancer
==========

Cryomancer's Ascension, a adventure and exploration Unity3D game.

It features three distinct levels:
1. A small platforming dungeon to teach the player the primary movement mechanics.
2. A boss encounter with the Dark Tyrant.
3. A bonus stage where the player must survive as long as possible in a massive cathedral being destroyed by wrecking balls.

Player abilities:
Q: Ascend (create icy platforms below the player so they can quickly climb)
E: Glide (run and jump on the air creating icy platforms below each step)
Shift: Fling (launch yourself in the target direction
Tab: Shield (Create a frigid barrier to halt enemies in their tracks or reflect projectiles)

I learned a significant amount from this project which eventually built into Ataraxy and later Attunement.
